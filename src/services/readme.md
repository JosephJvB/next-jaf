Have an issue where `googleapis` npm package is only valid server side, can't be used on client

So maybe I should split my code based on that?

It's useful for me to be able to get plants from server side before page load

It's also necessary to be able to update the sheet from frontend - yeah I could make an API request to my server first, but that seems overkill

Also I really dislike the `import * as x` pattern, it makes autocomplete tougher
